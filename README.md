Simple blockbreaker game using Unity and C#. Blockbreaker is a game where the user can use their mouse or arrow keys to 
control a slider to hit a ball that goes randomly at angles. Once it touches different blocks, it will break them. Once 
the user breaks all the blocks, the user wins. 

(Unfinished for now >_<)
